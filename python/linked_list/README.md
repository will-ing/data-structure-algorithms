# Singly Linked List
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

## Challenge
- Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
- Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
- Define a method called toString (or __str__ in Python) which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

## Approach & Efficiency
Time - O(n)\
Space - O(1)
