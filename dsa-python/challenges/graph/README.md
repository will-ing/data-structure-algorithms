# Graphs

A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

## Challenge

Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

* AddNode
* AddEdge
* GetNodes
* GetNeighbors
* Size
