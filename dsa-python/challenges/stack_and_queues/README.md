# Stacks and Queues
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Creating a module that has stack and queue classes.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.\
Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.\
Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.\


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

time = O(1)
space = O(1)
This is cause the list sizes can vary
